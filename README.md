# hostile-aliens
Friday Challenge from _nology I completed in few hours. 

## Description
A group of hostile aliens have parked up in earth's orbit, we need to strike first! 
Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet. Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced. Once an alien ship's points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and canâ€™t be hit again. The game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed.
